Hey everyone! I recently built an interactive dashboard in Tableau that looks at global happiness trends from 2015 to 2024 — and I'm excited to finally share it! 🎉

This project dives into what drives happiness across countries — from generosity and freedom to corruption perception — and how these factors vary by region and over time.

Some highlights:

📊 Year-over-year comparisons with slope and bar charts

🗺️ A world map to explore happiness rankings across countries

🎛️ Filters so you can dig into specific years and regions

👀 Clean, simple visuals focused on telling a clear story

My goal was to go beyond just charts and numbers — I wanted to create something that’s easy to explore, and helps spark curiosity about what really makes people happier in different parts of the world.

Would love to hear your thoughts and feedback!
